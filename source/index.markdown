### About my Work and Tech Interests

I’ve worked in technology for Bank of America since 1998. I presently manage Level 3 support in ATM Technology but have held many different positions over the years.   I spent several years as a developer working mostly with .NET and related Microsoft technologies.  I’ve been in various architecture and management roles (some with lots of hands-on, some not so much ) since 2006 but have continued to pursue technical interests on my own as well.

As a hobbyist I have done a few small projects in Ruby on Rails – my first started at around Rails version .10 but I have never done enough of it to really become proficient. Still the experience has added up over the years and lately I’ve been getting comfortable with Rails 3. Most recently I've been experimenting with functional languages and having the most fun hacking on [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).  I’ve been hacking on Linux off and on since 1996 but in the last couple of years I’ve really gotten deeper into it, partly as a result of my job giving me the opportunity to play a pseudo-admin role on RHEL. At home I use Ubuntu.

### Family

Heather and I have been married for more than ten years and it seems they have just flown by. Our son Jonah joined us in 2009 and has been a tremendous blessing. His sister Laura joined us in September 2012. Most of my time outside of work is spent with my family.
