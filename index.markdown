You can email me if you can guess the address. Hint: firstname@firstnamelastname.com .

You can find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JeremyHuffman) and [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyhuffman). I also have a couple of small projects on [Github](https://github.com/jeremyjh).

### About my Work and Tech Interests

Since July 2017 I've been a software developer at [Smart Metals Recycling](http://www.smartmetalsrecycling.com). We're an e-waste recycler and IT Asset Disposition company and employ a variety of means to extract the most value possible from disposed mobile devices and computers. Our small development team develops and integrates software that is used to run our operations and track the various activities we do to measure profitability and other key metrics. We're using the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) language with the [Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org) for the backend and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) for the front-end. This has been a lot of fun so far, I get to spend the vast majority of my time writing code and we build and deploy features frequently.

Previously I worked in technology for Bank of America for a long time. In my last position I managed Level 3 software support in ATM Technology but held many different positions over the years. I spent several years as a developer working mostly with C# and related technologies. I assumed various architecture and management roles (some with lots of hands-on, some not so much ) but continued to pursue technical interests on my own as well. In ATM my team did some operational support but mostly were focused on software maintenance for the Bank's extensions and customizations to the ATM client software as well as some of the custom server-side applications that the ATM uses. I was very hands-on in this role and there is a bit of C++ code I've written running in every BAC ATM transaction.

As a hobbyist I have done a few small projects in Ruby on Rails – my first started at around Rails version .10 but I have never done enough Rails in any one version to become really proficient. In 2012 I started on a languages kick and have dabbled in several functional languages - starting with Odersky's [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) course at Coursera and then a few months dive into [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) and [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) which resulted in a couple of [small libraries](projects), one of which is still in use in that community. This led directly to my present job; it was my interest in doing functional programming full time that led me to Smart Metals where they had just begun development of their SmartERP in Elixir/Phoenix.

I spent nearly three years doing a fair amount of [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) development. I have a few small libraries on Hackage, listed on the [projects](projects) page. I've also had forays into C++11 (for Game development) and Rust, though I have not released much of my own work in those languages.

I’ve been hacking on Linux off and on since 1996 but in the last several years I’ve really gotten deeper into it as a result of it becoming more applicable in my day job, where we use RHEL and Cygwin. At home I've used Ubuntu and Arch for years and I still use Ubuntu in personal projects but for my daily driver I recently switched to a Macbook Pro - my first Apple since my old Powerbook died in 2010.

### Family

Heather and I have been married for more than fifteen years and it seems they have just flown by. Our son Jonah joined us in 2009 and has been a tremendous blessing. His sister Laura joined us in September 2012\. Most of my time outside of work is spent with my family.
